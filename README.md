# 👨🏻‍💻 🌎 🔐 Building a SOC Analysis Lab Environment At Home 👨🏻‍💻 🌎 🔐
## Lab Overview

This SOC Analyst home lab is an excellent opportunity to learn new skills beyond the basics and fundamentals. It involves a hands-on experience such as setting up virtualized environments, deploying operating systems, honing command line proficiency, and establishing C2 servers. The primary goal of the lab is to provide practical cybersecurity skills, addressing both offensive and defensive roles. It encompasses telemetry and EDR analysis using tools like Sysmon and LimaCharlie.
Through this structured exploration, individuals gain a comprehensive understanding of security operations. This knowledge serves as a solid base for a seamless transition into cloud security engineering, enhancing proficiency in handling various cybersecurity challenges.

## Requirements

Before proceeding, ensure that you have Kali Linux installed, or have access to a Kali Linux environment to execute the commands and utilize OWASP ZAP for web application security assessments.

## Updating Package Lists

Ensures that the package lists on the Linux system are updated, allowing for upgrades and new package installations.
          (sudo apt update)

## Installing and Enabling Docker

Setting up Docker involves installing the platform,

          sudo apt install docker.io          
starting the Docker service,

          sudo systemctl start docker
and configuring it for automatic initiation during system boot.

          sudo systemctl enable docker
This facilitates containerization, providing a consistent environment for running applications and ensuring persistent availability.

          sudo systemctl status docker

## Pulling OWASP ZAP Docker Image
Retrieves the Docker image named (zap2docker-weekly), from the (ictu) repository, containing the OWASP ZAP toolset for security scanning.

          sudo docker pull ictu/zap2docker-weekly

## Running OWASP ZAP in Docker Container

Executes a container based on the (zap2docker-weekly) image in interactive mode, launching a Bash shell within the container for manual operations or configurations.

          docker run -it ictu/zap2docker-weekly /bin/bash

## Executing Automated OWASP ZAP Security Scan

Initiates an automated security scan using OWASP ZAP within the Docker container. Parameters like '-I' for headless mode, '-j' for JSON output, defining the test report location, specifying authentication details, and more, configure the scan to assess the security posture of a target web application.
As I'm gonna test this Web Application (http://demo.testfire.net/login.jsp).

            docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/zap/wrk/:rw -t ictu/zap2docker-weekly zap-baseline.py -I -j \
            -t http://demo.testfire.net/ \
            -r /zap/wrk/testreport.html \
            --hook=/zap/auth_hook.py \
            -z "auth.loginurl=http://demo.testfire.net/login.jsp" \
            -z "auth.username=admin" \
            -z "auth.password=admin"

Once this scan will finish, we will be able to get the report.

## Output Report Generated by OWASP ZAP

The generated report presents the comprehensive security scan report produced by OWASP ZAP. The report contains detailed insights into potential vulnerabilities, security risks, and recommendations identified during the automated assessment of the target web application. Analyzing this report is crucial for understanding and addressing security weaknesses to enhance the overall resilience of the web application against potential cyber threats.

![image](https://github.com/forza-dc/Enhancing-Web-Application-Security-DevSecOps-and-OWASP-ZAP/blob/main/Security%20Alert%20with%20Details.png) 

The report indicates a minimal presence of high-risk issues (0), a moderate number of medium (5) and low-risk (7) alerts, alongside several informational findings (9). False positives remain absent (0), reflecting a balanced risk posture overall.

| Summary of Alerts  | Risk Level      | Number of Alerts |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------------|
|     :no_entry_sign: | High            |        0         |
|     :warning:       | Medium          |        5         |
|     :large_blue_diamond: | Low         |        7         |
|     :information_source: | Informational |        9         |
|     :white_check_mark: | False Positives|        0         |

## Conclusion

After the completion of the scan, no high-risk vulnerabilities were found. However, a considerable number of medium and low-risk issues, alongside informational findings, were detected.
Medium-risk vulnerabilities, observed in instances such as the absence of Anti-CSRF tokens, improperly configured Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, and the omission of Anti-clickjacking headers, identify potential weak points that, if left unattended, could lead to security breaches.
Furthermore, low-risk concerns, such as the absence of the SameSite attribute in cookies, potential Cross-Domain JavaScript Source File Inclusions, and misconfigured headers, while not posing an immediate threat, highlight areas where reinforcing security measures could enhance the web application's defense posture.

👨🏻‍💻 🚀 In summary, the OWASP ZAP Vulnerability Scanner effectively identifies a range of vulnerabilities and areas for enhancement within the scanned site. By addressing these findings through suitable mitigation strategies - such as implementing missing security headers, refining input validation, and improving session management - the potential attack surface can be significantly reduced, fortifying the overall security stance of the site against potential threats. 👨🏻‍💻 🚀
