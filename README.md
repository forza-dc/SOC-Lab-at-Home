4. Click on any event to see the details.
5. Now we will create a Detection & Response rule for this event.

  ![image](https://github.com/forza-dc/SOC-Lab-at-Home/blob/main/SOC%20Lab%20Image%2041.jpg)

6. In the "Detect" section of the new rule, remove all contents and replace them with this
   
        event: SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS
        op: ends with
        path: event/*/TARGET/FILE_PATH value: lsass.exe

  ![image](https://github.com/forza-dc/SOC-Lab-at-Home/blob/main/SOC%20Lab%20Image%2042.jpg)

8. In the "Respond" section of the new rule, remove all contents and replace them with this

        action: report name: LSASS access

  ![image](https://github.com/forza-dc/SOC-Lab-at-Home/blob/main/SOC%20Lab%20Image%2043.jpg)

9. Now test the Rule by clicking on "Test Event" at the bottom of the page.

  ![image](https://github.com/forza-dc/SOC-Lab-at-Home/blob/main/SOC%20Lab%20Image%2044.jpg)

10. Save the Rule and give it a name

  ![image](https://github.com/forza-dc/SOC-Lab-at-Home/blob/main/SOC%20Lab%20Image%2045.jpg)

11. Now return to Sliver server console and rerun the same procdump command. After rerunning the procdump command, go to the "Detections" tab on the LimaCharlie main left-side menu.

2. In the new System shell, run the following command

       vssadmin delete shadows /all

3. Browse over to LimaCharlie's detection tab to see default Sigma rules.

  ![image](https://github.com/forza-dc/SOC-Lab-at-Home/blob/main/SOC%20Lab%20Image%2047.jpg)

4. Click to expand the detection and examine all of the metadata contained within the detection itself.

5. Craft a Detection & Response (D&R) rule from this event.

  ![image](https://github.com/forza-dc/SOC-Lab-at-Home/blob/main/SOC%20Lab%20Image%2048.jpg)

6. Add the following Response rule to the Respond section.

  ![image](https://github.com/forza-dc/SOC-Lab-at-Home/blob/main/SOC%20Lab%20Image%2049.jpg)

7. Save your rule with the following name: vss_deletion_kill_it.

8. Run the command to delete volume shadows again (vssadmin delete shadows /all). The command will return with the same error but the execution of command is enough to trigger the incident. Then type command "whoami". If our D&R rule worked successfully, the system shell will hang and fail to return anything from the whoami command, because the parent process was terminated.

  ![image](https://github.com/forza-dc/SOC-Lab-at-Home/blob/main/SOC%20Lab%20Image%2050.jpg)

9. Terminate your (now dead) system shell by pressing Ctrl + D.
